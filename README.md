## Introduction

This project integrates the advanced technology of the Unitree robot with the educational and innovation goals of the EMFUTECH program, facilitated by Mirai Innovation Lab. Rather than a collaboration, this acquisition allows us to offer a comprehensive educational experience, enabling participants to deeply explore emerging technologies through hands-on interaction with state-of-the-art robotics. By incorporating the Unitree robot, we not only enhance practical learning in sophisticated technological domains but also foster the creation of innovative solutions poised to revolutionize our daily technological interactions.

This project integrates the Unitree robot's cutting-edge technology with the educational and innovation goals of the EMFUTECH program, led by Mirai Innovation Lab. Our approach aims to enrich the educational experience by leveraging emerging technologies. Key objectives include:

- **Enhancing Learning**: Providing practical interaction with robotics to deepen the understanding of technological advancements.
- **Driving Innovation**: Encouraging the development of innovative solutions that have the potential to transform our daily technological interactions.
- **Bridging Theory and Practice**: Utilizing the Unitree robot as a practical tool to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

# Installation and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up your Unitree Go2 robot and prepare it for operation:

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Unitree Go2 SDK installed on your computer.
- Confirm all components and parts are present and in good condition.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Go2

1. **Battery Installation**: Securely insert the battery pack into the robot, ensuring the power switch is facing upwards.

2. **Body Placement**: Place Go2 on a flat surface to ensure proper posture for startup.

## Step 2: Powering Up

- Turn on Go2 by pressing the power button briefly, then holding it for two seconds until the robot starts and the head indicator light turns green.

## Step 3: Connecting to the App

1. **App Binding**: Download and install the Unitree Go App, then follow the in-app instructions to bind your Go2 for the first time. : [APP](https://www.unitree.com/app/go2/)

2. **Remote Control (Optional)**: If using a handheld remote, bind it through the app before use.

## Step 4: First Commands

- Use the Unitree Go App or voice commands (for EDU version) to control Go2, executing basic movements or custom actions.
You can follow [APP Fisrts Steps](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/App%20binding )

## Troubleshooting

- For any operational issues, refer to the Go2 User Manual or contact Unitree's support for guidance.

For detailed operation, refer to the [Go2 User Manual](https://physical-computing-lab.net/wp-content/uploads/Go2-User-Manual.pdf) or visit the [Unitree official website](https://www.unitree.com/support) for more information.

# Quick Start Guide

Get started with your Unitree Go2 robot by running your first demo program. This guide assumes you have completed the installation and configuration steps. 

## Step 1: Connect to Your Robot

- Ensure your robot is powered on and connected to your computer or network.

## Step 2: Download the Demo Code

- Download the demo code from the [Unitree Quick Start](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/Quick_start).

## Step 3: Compile and Run

- Navigate to the demo code directory.
- Compile the code using the provided instructions. For example, if it's a C++ program, you might use a command like `g++ -o demo demo.cpp`.
- Run the compiled program. For instance, `./demo`.

## Step 4: Observe

- Watch as your Unitree Go2 robot executes the programmed actions. This could be a simple movement sequence or a more complex task.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, check the documentation for troubleshooting tips or contact support for help.

Remember, this is just the beginning! Explore more advanced programming options and capabilities of your Unitree Go2 robot to fully unlock its potential.
